# Quick Starts

The following quick starts provide both a video and a text based example that are very minimal but are here to help you get started with using MassTransit. We recommend that you first start with the in-memory quick start, and then when you have that up and running switch to the transport of choice.

Everything builds off of the in-memory so start [here](/quick-starts/in-memory)
::

From there you can jump off to the transport of your choice.
