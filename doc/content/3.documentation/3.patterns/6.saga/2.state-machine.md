# Saga State Machines

> Previously known as Automatonymous, saga state machines were merged into the MassTransit codebase starting with v8.

## Introduction

Automatonymous is a state machine library for .NET and provides a C# syntax to define a state machine, including states, events, and behaviors. MassTransit
includes Automatonymous, and adds instance storage, event correlation, message binding, request and response support, and scheduling.

::alert{type="info"}
Automatonymous is no longer a separate NuGet package and has been assimilated by _MassTransit_. In previous versions, an additional package reference was
required. If _Automatonymous_ is referenced, that reference must be removed as it is no longer compatible.
::

### State Machine

A state machine defines the states, events, and behavior of a finite state machine. Implemented as a class, which is derived from `MassTransitStateMachine<T>`,
a state machine is created once, and then used to apply event triggered behavior to state machine _instances_.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
}
```

### Instance

An instance contains the data for a state machine _instance_. A new instance is created for every consumed _initial_ event where an existing instance with the
same _CorrelationId_ was not found. A saga repository is used to persist instances. Instances are classes, and must implement the `SagaStateMachineInstance`
interface.

```csharp
public class OrderState :
    SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }
    public string CurrentState { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        InstanceState(x => x.CurrentState);
    }
}
```

An instance must store the current state, which can be one of three types:

| Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| State  | The interface `State` type. Can be difficult to serialize, typically only used for in-memory instances, but could be used if the repository storage engine supports mapping user types to a storage type. |
| string | Easy, stores the state name. However, it takes a lot of space as the state name is repeated for every instance.                                                                                           |
| int    | Small, fast, but requires that each possible state be specified, in order, to assign _int_ values to each state.                                                                                          |

The _CurrentState_ instance state property is automatically configured if it is a `State`. For `string` or `int` types, the `InstanceState` method must be used.

To specify the _int_ state values, configure the instance state as shown below.

```csharp
public class OrderState :
    SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }
    public int CurrentState { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        InstanceState(x => x.CurrentState, Submitted, Accepted);
    }
}
```

This results in the following values: 0 - None, 1 - Initial, 2 - Final, 3 - Submitted, 4 - Accepted

### State

States represent previously consumed events resulting in an instance being in a current _state_. An instance can only be in one state at a given time. A new
instance defaults to the _Initial_ state, which is automatically defined. The _Final_ state is also defined for all state machines and is used to signify the
instance has reached the final state.

In the example, two states are declared. States are automatically initialized by the _MassTransitStateMachine_ base class constructor.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; }
    public State Accepted { get; private set; }
}
```

### Event

An event is something that happened which may result in a state change. An event can add or update instance data, as well as changing an instance's current
state. The `Event<T>` is generic, where `T` must be a valid message type.

In the example below, the _SubmitOrder_ message is declared as an event including how to correlate the event to an instance.

> Unless events implement `CorrelatedBy<Guid>`, they must be declared with a correlation expression.

```csharp
public interface SubmitOrder
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => SubmitOrder, x => x.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId));
    }

    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; }
}
```

### Behavior

Behavior is what happens when an _event_ occurs during a _state_.

Below, the _Initially_ block is used to define the behavior of the _SubmitOrder_ event during the _Initial_ state. When a _SubmitOrder_ message is consumed and
an instance with a _CorrelationId_ matching the _OrderId_ is not found, a new instance will be created in the _Initial_ state. The _TransitionTo_ activity
transitions the instance to the _Submitted_ state, after which the instance is persisted using the saga repository.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }
}
```

Subsequently, the _OrderAccepted_ event could be handled by the behavior shown below.

```csharp
public interface OrderAccepted
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => OrderAccepted, x => x.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId));

        During(Submitted,
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));
    }

    public Event<OrderAccepted> OrderAccepted { get; private set; }
}
```

#### Message Order

Message brokers typically do not guarantee message order. Therefore, it is important to consider out-of-order messages in state machine design.

In the example above, receiving a _SubmitOrder_ message after an _OrderAccepted_ event could cause the _SubmitOrder_ message to end up in the *_error* queue. If
the _OrderAccepted_ event is received first, it would be discarded since it isn't accepted in the _Initial_ state. Below is an updated state machine that
handles both of these scenarios.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .TransitionTo(Submitted),
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));

        During(Submitted,
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));

        During(Accepted,
            Ignore(SubmitOrder));
    }
}
```

In the updated example, receiving a _SubmitOrder_ message while in an _Accepted_ state ignores the event. However, data in the event may be useful. In that
case, adding behavior to copy the data to the instance could be added. Below, data from the event is captured in both scenarios.

```csharp
public interface SubmitOrder
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }

    DateTime OrderDate { get; }
}

public class OrderState :
    SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }
    public string CurrentState { get; set; }

    public DateTime? OrderDate { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .Then(x => x.Saga.OrderDate = x.Message.OrderDate)
                .TransitionTo(Submitted),
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));

        During(Submitted,
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));

        During(Accepted,
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .Then(x => x.Saga.OrderDate = x.Message.OrderDate));
    }
}
```

### Configuration

To configure a saga state machine:

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddSagaStateMachine<OrderStateMachine, OrderState>()
        .InMemoryRepository();
});
```

The example above uses the in-memory saga repository, but any saga repository could be used. The [persistence](/documentation/configuration#persistence) section
includes details on the supported saga repositories.

To test the state machine, see the [testing](/documentation/concepts/testing#saga-state-machine) section.

## Event

As shown above, an event is a message that can be consumed by the state machine. Events can specify any valid message type, and each event may be configured.
There are several event configuration methods available.

The built-in `CorrelatedBy<Guid>` interface can be used in a message contract to specify the event `CorrelationId`.

```csharp
public interface OrderCanceled :
    CorrelatedBy<Guid>
{    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => OrderCanceled); // not required, as it is the default convention
    }
}
```

While the event is declared explicitly above, it is not required. The default convention will automatically configure events that have a `CorrelatedBy<Guid>`
interface.

While convenient, some consider the interface an intrusion of infrastructure to the message contract. MassTransit also supports a declarative approach to
specifying the `CorrelationId` for events. By configuring the global message topology, it is possible to specify a message property to use for correlation.

```csharp
public interface SubmitOrder
{    
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    // this is shown here, but can be anywhere in the application as long as it executes
    // before the state machine instance is created. Startup, etc. is a good place for it.
    // It only needs to be called once per process.
    static OrderStateMachine()
    {
        GlobalTopology.Send.UseCorrelationId<SubmitOrder>(x => x.OrderId);
    }

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => SubmitOrder);
    }

    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; }
}
```

An alternative is to declare the event correlation, as shown below. This should be used when neither of the approaches above are used.

```csharp
public interface SubmitOrder
{    
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => SubmitOrder, x => x.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId));
    }

    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; }
}
```

Since `OrderId` is a `Guid`, it can be used for event correlation. When `SubmitOrder` is accepted in the _Initial_ state, and because the _OrderId_ is a _Guid_,
the `CorrelationId` on the new instance is automatically assigned the _OrderId_ value.

Events can also be correlated using a query expression, which is required when events are not correlated to the instance's _CorrelationId_ property. Queries are
more expensive, and may match multiple instances, which should be considered when designing state machines and events.

> Whenever possible, try to correlation using the CorrelationId. If a query is required, it may be necessary to create an index on the property so that database
> queries are optimized.

To correlate events using another type, additional configuration is required.

```csharp
public interface ExternalOrderSubmitted
{    
    string OrderNumber { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => ExternalOrderSubmitted, e => e
            .CorrelateBy(i => i.OrderNumber, x => x.Message.OrderNumber)
            .SelectId(x => NewId.NextGuid()));
    }

    public Event<ExternalOrderSubmitted> ExternalOrderSubmitted { get; private set; }
}
```

Queries can also be written with two arguments, which are passed directly to the repository (and must be supported by the backing database).

```csharp
public interface ExternalOrderSubmitted
{    
    string OrderNumber { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => ExternalOrderSubmitted, e => e
            .CorrelateBy((instance,context) => instance.OrderNumber == context.Message.OrderNumber)
            .SelectId(x => NewId.NextGuid()));
    }

    public Event<ExternalOrderSubmitted> ExternalOrderSubmitted { get; private set; }
}
```

When the event doesn't have a _Guid_ that uniquely correlates to an instance, the `.SelectId` expression must be configured. In the above
example, [NewId](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NewId) is used to generate a sequential identifier which will be assigned to the instance _CorrelationId_. Any
property on the event can be used to initialize the _CorrelationId_.

::alert{type="warning"}
Initial events that do not correlate on CorrelationId, and use `SelectId` to generate a _CorrelationId_ should use a unique constraint on the instance
property (_OrderNumber_ in this example) to avoid duplicate instances. If two events correlate to the same property value at the same time, only one of the two
will be able to store the instance, the other will fail (and, if retry is configured, which it should be when using a saga) and retry at which time the event
will be dispatched based upon the current instance state (which is likely no longer Initial). Failure to apply a unique constraint (on _OrderNumber_ in this
example) will result in duplicates.
::

The message headers are also available, for example, instead of always generating a new identifier, the _CorrelationId_ header could be used if present.

```csharp
            .SelectId(x => x.CorrelationId ?? NewId.NextGuid());
```

::alert{type="info"}
Event correlation is critical, and should be consistently applied to all events on a state machine. Consider how events received in different orders may affect
subsequent event correlations.
::

### Ignore Event

It may be necessary to ignore an event in a given state, either to avoid fault generation, or to prevent messages from being moved to the *_skipped* queue. To
ignore an event in a state, use the `Ignore` method.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .TransitionTo(Submitted),
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));

        During(Submitted,
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));

        During(Accepted,
            Ignore(SubmitOrder));
    }
}
```

### Composite Event

A composite event is configured by specifying one or more events that must be consumed, after which the composite event will be raised. A composite event uses
an instance property to keep track of the required events, which is specified during configuration.

To define a composite event, the required events must first be configured along with any event behaviors, after which the composite event can be configured.

```csharp
public class OrderState :
    SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }
    public string CurrentState { get; set; }

    public int ReadyEventStatus { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .TransitionTo(Submitted),
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));

        During(Submitted,
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));

        CompositeEvent(() => OrderReady, x => x.ReadyEventStatus, SubmitOrder, OrderAccepted);

        DuringAny(
            When(OrderReady)
                .Then(context => Console.WriteLine("Order Ready: {0}", context.Saga.CorrelationId)));
    }

    public Event OrderReady { get; private set; }
}
```

Once the _SubmitOrder_ and _OrderAccepted_ events have been consumed, the _OrderReady_ event will be triggered.

::alert{type="warning"}
The order of events being declared can impact the order in which they execute. Therefore, it is best to declare composite events at the end of the state machine
declaration, after all other events and behaviors are declared. That way, the composite events will be raised _after_ the dependent event behaviors.
::

### Missing Instance

If an event is not matching to an instance, the missing instance behavior can be configured.

```csharp
public interface RequestOrderCancellation
{    
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public interface OrderNotFound
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => OrderCancellationRequested, e =>
        {
            e.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId);

            e.OnMissingInstance(m =>
            {
                return m.ExecuteAsync(x => x.RespondAsync<OrderNotFound>(new { x.OrderId }));
            });
        });
    }

    public Event<RequestOrderCancellation> OrderCancellationRequested { get; private set; }
}

```

In this example, when a cancel order request is consumed without a matching instance, a response will be sent that the order was not found. Instead of
generating a `Fault`, the response is more explicit. Other missing instance options include `Discard`, `Fault`, and `Execute` (a synchronous version of
_ExecuteAsync_).

### Initial Insert

To increase new instance performance, configuring an event to directly insert into a saga repository may reduce lock contention. To configure an event to
insert, it should be in the _Initially_ block, as well as have a saga factory specified.

```csharp
public interface SubmitOrder
{    
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => SubmitOrder, e => 
        {
            e.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId));

            e.InsertOnInitial = true;
            e.SetSagaFactory(context => new OrderState
            {
                CorrelationId = context.Message.OrderId
            })
        });

        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }

    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; }
}
```

When using _InsertOnInitial_, it is critical that the saga repository is able to detect duplicate keys (in this case, _CorrelationId_ - which is initialized
using _OrderId_). In this case, having a clustered primary key on _CorrelationId_ would prevent duplicate instances from being inserted. If an event is
correlated using a different property, make sure that the database enforces a unique constraint on the instance property and the saga factory initializes the
instance property with the event property value.

```csharp
public interface ExternalOrderSubmitted
{    
    string OrderNumber { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => ExternalOrderSubmitted, e => 
        {
            e.CorrelateBy(i => i.OrderNumber, x => x.Message.OrderNumber)
            e.SelectId(x => NewId.NextGuid());

            e.InsertOnInitial = true;
            e.SetSagaFactory(context => new OrderState
            {
                CorrelationId = context.CorrelationId ?? NewId.NextGuid(),
                OrderNumber = context.Message.OrderNumber,
            })
        });

        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }

    public Event<ExternalOrderSubmitted> ExternalOrderSubmitted { get; private set; }
}
```

The database would use a unique constraint on the _OrderNumber_ to prevent duplicates, which the saga repository would detect as an existing instance, which
would then be loaded to consume the event.

### Completed Instance

By default, instances are not removed from the saga repository. To configure completed instance removal, specify the method used to determine if an instance has
completed.

```csharp
public interface OrderCompleted
{    
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => OrderCompleted, x => x.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId));

        DuringAny(
            When(OrderCompleted)
                .Finalize());

        SetCompletedWhenFinalized();
    }

    public Event<OrderCompleted> OrderCompleted { get; private set; }
}
```

When the instance consumes the _OrderCompleted_ event, the instance is finalized (which transitions the instance to the _Final_ state).
The `SetCompletedWhenFinalized` method defines an instance in the _Final_ state as completed – which is then used by the saga repository to remove the instance.

To use a different completed expression, such as one that checks if the instance is in a _Completed_ state, use the `SetCompleted` method as shown below.

```csharp
public interface OrderCompleted
{    
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => OrderCompleted, x => x.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId));

        DuringAny(
            When(OrderCompleted)
                .TransitionTo(Completed));

        SetCompleted(async instance => 
        {
            State<TInstance> currentState = await this.GetState(instance);

            return Completed.Equals(currentState);
        });
    }

    public State Completed { get; private set; }
    public Event<OrderCompleted> OrderCompleted { get; private set; }
}
```

## Activities

State machine behaviors are defined as a sequence of activities which are executed in response to an event. In addition to the activities included with
Automatonymous, MassTransit includes activities to send, publish, and schedule messages, as well as initiate and respond to requests.

### Publish

To publish an event, add a `Publish` activity.

```csharp
public interface OrderSubmitted
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderSubmittedEvent :
    OrderSubmitted
{
    public OrderSubmittedEvent(Guid orderId)
    {
        OrderId = orderId;
    }

    public Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .Publish(context => (OrderSubmitted)new OrderSubmittedEvent(context.Saga.CorrelationId))
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }
}
```

Alternatively, a message initializer can be used to eliminate the _Event_ class.

```csharp
public interface OrderSubmitted
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .PublishAsync(context => context.Init<OrderSubmitted>(new { OrderId = context.Saga.CorrelationId }))
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }
}
```

### Send

To send a message, add a `Send` activity.

```csharp
public interface UpdateAccountHistory
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class UpdateAccountHistoryCommand :
    UpdateAccountHistory
{
    public UpdateAccountHistoryCommand(Guid orderId)
    {
        OrderId = orderId;
    }

    public Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine(OrderStateMachineSettings settings)
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .Send(settings.AccountServiceAddress, context => new UpdateAccountHistoryCommand(context.Saga.CorrelationId))
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }
}
```

Alternatively, a message initializer can be used to eliminate the _Command_ class.

```csharp
public interface UpdateAccountHistory
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine(OrderStateMachineSettings settings)
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .SendAsync(settings.AccountServiceAddress, context => context.Init<UpdateAccountHistory>(new { OrderId = context.Saga.CorrelationId }))
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }
}
```

### Respond

A state machine can respond to requests by configuring the request message type as an event, and using the `Respond` method. When configuring a request event,
configuring a missing instance method is recommended, to provide a better response experience (either through a different response type, or a response that
indicates an instance was not found).

```csharp
public interface RequestOrderCancellation
{    
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public interface OrderCanceled
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public interface OrderNotFound
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => OrderCancellationRequested, e =>
        {
            e.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId);

            e.OnMissingInstance(m =>
            {
                return m.ExecuteAsync(x => x.RespondAsync<OrderNotFound>(new { x.OrderId }));
            });
        });

        DuringAny(
            When(OrderCancellationRequested)
                .RespondAsync(context => context.Init<OrderCanceled>(new { OrderId = context.Saga.CorrelationId }))
                .TransitionTo(Canceled));
    }

    public State Canceled { get; private set; }
    public Event<RequestOrderCancellation> OrderCancellationRequested { get; private set; }
}
```

There are scenarios where it is required to _wait_ for the response from the state machine. In these scenarios the information that is required to respond to
the original request should be stored.

```csharp
public record CreateOrder(Guid CorrelationId) : CorrelatedBy<Guid>;

public record ProcessOrder(Guid OrderId, Guid ProcessingId);

public record OrderProcessed(Guid OrderId, Guid ProcessingId);

public record OrderCancelled(Guid OrderId, string Reason);

public class ProcessOrderConsumer : IConsumer<ProcessOrder>
{
    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<ProcessOrder> context)
    {
        await context.RespondAsync(new OrderProcessed(context.Message.OrderId, context.Message.ProcessingId));
    }
}

public class OrderState : SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }
    public string CurrentState { get; set; }
    public Guid? ProcessingId { get; set; }
    public Guid? RequestId { get; set; }
    public Uri ResponseAddress { get; set; }
    public Guid OrderId { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine : MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Created { get; set; }
    
    public State Cancelled { get; set; }
    
    public Event<CreateOrder> OrderSubmitted { get; set; }
    
    public Request<OrderState, ProcessOrder, OrderProcessed> ProcessOrder { get; set; }
    
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        InstanceState(m => m.CurrentState);
        Event(() => OrderSubmitted);
        Request(() => ProcessOrder, order => order.ProcessingId, config => { config.Timeout = TimeSpan.Zero; });

        Initially(
            When(OrderSubmitted)
                .Then(context =>
                {
                    context.Saga.CorrelationId = context.Message.CorrelationId;
                    context.Saga.ProcessingId = Guid.NewGuid();

                    context.Saga.OrderId = Guid.NewGuid();

                    context.Saga.RequestId = context.RequestId;
                    context.Saga.ResponseAddress = context.ResponseAddress;
                })
                .Request(ProcessOrder, context => new ProcessOrder(context.Saga.OrderId, context.Saga.ProcessingId!.Value))
                .TransitionTo(ProcessOrder.Pending));
        
        During(ProcessOrder.Pending,
            When(ProcessOrder.Completed)
                .TransitionTo(Created)
                .ThenAsync(async context =>
                {
                    var endpoint = await context.GetSendEndpoint(context.Saga.ResponseAddress);
                    await endpoint.Send(context.Saga, r => r.RequestId = context.Saga.RequestId);
                }),
            When(ProcessOrder.Faulted)
                .TransitionTo(Cancelled)
                .ThenAsync(async context =>
                {
                    var endpoint = await context.GetSendEndpoint(context.Saga.ResponseAddress);
                    await endpoint.Send(new OrderCancelled(context.Saga.OrderId, "Faulted"), r => r.RequestId = context.Saga.RequestId);
                }),
            When(ProcessOrder.TimeoutExpired)
                .TransitionTo(Cancelled)
                .ThenAsync(async context =>
                {
                    var endpoint = await context.GetSendEndpoint(context.Saga.ResponseAddress);
                    await endpoint.Send(new OrderCancelled(context.Saga.OrderId, "Time-out"), r => r.RequestId = context.Saga.RequestId);
                }));
    }
}
```

### Schedule

::alert{type="info"}
The bus must be configured to include a message scheduler to use the scheduling activities. See the [scheduling](/documentation/configuration/scheduling/)
section to learn how to set up a message scheduler.
::

A state machine can schedule events, which uses the message scheduler to schedule a message for delivery to the instance. First, the schedule must be declared.

```csharp
public interface OrderCompletionTimeoutExpired
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderState :
    SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }
    public string CurrentState { get; set; }

    public Guid? OrderCompletionTimeoutTokenId { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Schedule(() => OrderCompletionTimeout, instance => instance.OrderCompletionTimeoutTokenId, s =>
        {
            s.Delay = TimeSpan.FromDays(30);

            s.Received = r => r.CorrelateById(context => context.Message.OrderId);
        });
    }

    public Schedule<OrderState, OrderCompletionTimeoutExpired> OrderCompletionTimeout { get; private set; }
}
```

The configuration specifies the _Delay_, which can be overridden by the schedule activity, and the correlation expression for the _Received_ event. The state
machine can consume the _Received_ event as shown. The _OrderCompletionTimeoutTokenId_ is a `Guid?` instance property used to keep track of the scheduled
message _tokenId_ which can later be used to unschedule the event.

```csharp
public interface OrderCompleted
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        During(Accepted,
            When(OrderCompletionTimeout.Received)
                .PublishAsync(context => context.Init<OrderCompleted>(new { OrderId = context.Saga.CorrelationId }))
                .Finalize());
    }

    public Schedule<OrderState, OrderCompletionTimeoutExpired> OrderCompletionTimeout { get; private set; }
}
```

The event can be scheduled using the `Schedule` activity.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        During(Submitted,
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .Schedule(OrderCompletionTimeout, context => context.Init<OrderCompletionTimeoutExpired>(new { OrderId = context.Saga.CorrelationId }))
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));
    }
}
```

As stated above, the _delay_ can be overridden by the _Schedule_ activity. Both instance and message (_context.Data_) content can be used to calculate the
delay.

```csharp
public interface OrderAccepted
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
    TimeSpan CompletionTime { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        During(Submitted,
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .Schedule(OrderCompletionTimeout, context => context.Init<OrderCompletionTimeoutExpired>(new { OrderId = context.Saga.CorrelationId }),
                    context => context.Message.CompletionTime)
                .TransitionTo(Accepted));
    }
}
```

Once the scheduled event is received, the `OrderCompletionTimeoutTokenId` property is cleared.

If the scheduled event is no longer needed, the _Unschedule_ activity can be used.

```csharp
public interface OrderAccepted
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
    TimeSpan CompletionTime { get; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        DuringAny(
            When(OrderCancellationRequested)
                .RespondAsync(context => context.Init<OrderCanceled>(new { OrderId = context.Saga.CorrelationId }))
                .Unschedule(OrderCompletionTimeout)
                .TransitionTo(Canceled));
    }
}
```

### Request

A request can be sent by a state machine using the _Request_ method, which specifies the request type and the response type. Additional request settings may be
specified, including the _ServiceAddress_ and the _Timeout_.

If the _ServiceAddress_ is specified, it should be the endpoint address of the service that will respond to the request. If not specified, the request will be
published.

The default _Timeout_ is thirty seconds but any value greater than or equal to `TimeSpan.Zero` can be specified. When a request is sent with a timeout greater
than zero, a _TimeoutExpired_ message is scheduled. Specifying `TimeSpan.Zero` will not schedule a timeout message and the request will never time out.

::alert{type="info"}
When a _Timeout_ greater than `Timespan.Zero` is configured, a message scheduler must be configured. See
the [scheduling](/documentation/configuration/scheduling) section for details on configuring a message scheduler.
::

When defining a `Request`, an instance property _should_ be specified to store the _RequestId_ which is used to correlate responses to the state machine
instance. While the request is pending, the _RequestId_ is stored in the property. When the request has completed the property is cleared. If the request times
out or faults, the _RequestId_ is retained to allow for later correlation if requests are ultimately completed (such as moving requests from the *_error* queue
back into the service queue).

A recent enhancement making this property optional, instead using the instance's `CorrelationId` for the request message `RequestId`. This can simplify response
correlation, and also avoids the need of a supplemental index on the saga repository. However, reusing the `CorrelationId` for the request might cause issues in
highly complex systems. So consider this when choosing which method to use.

#### Configuration

To declare a request, add a `Request` property and configure it using the `Request` method.

```csharp
public interface ProcessOrder
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public interface OrderProcessed
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }
    Guid ProcessingId { get; }
}

public class OrderState :
    SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }
    public string CurrentState { get; set; }

    public Guid? ProcessOrderRequestId { get; set; }
    public Guid? ProcessingId { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine(OrderStateMachineSettings settings)
    {
        Request(
            () => ProcessOrder,
            x => x.ProcessOrderRequestId, // Optional
            r => {
                r.ServiceAddress = settings.ProcessOrderServiceAddress;
                r.Timeout = settings.RequestTimeout;
            });
    }

    public Request<OrderState, ProcessOrder, OrderProcessed> ProcessOrder { get; private set; }
}
```

Once defined, the request activity can be added to a behavior.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        During(Submitted,
            When(OrderAccepted)
                .Request(ProcessOrder, x => x.Init<ProcessOrder>(new { OrderId = x.Saga.CorrelationId}))
                .TransitionTo(ProcessOrder.Pending));

        During(ProcessOrder.Pending,
            When(ProcessOrder.Completed)
                .Then(context => context.Saga.ProcessingId = context.Message.ProcessingId)
                .TransitionTo(Processed),
            When(ProcessOrder.Faulted)
                .TransitionTo(ProcessFaulted),
            When(ProcessOrder.TimeoutExpired)
                .TransitionTo(ProcessTimeoutExpired));
    }

    public State Processed { get; private set; }
    public State ProcessFaulted { get; private set; }
    public State ProcessTimeoutExpired { get; private set; }
}
```

The _Request_ includes three events: _Completed_, _Faulted_, and _TimeoutExpired_. These events can be consumed during any state, however, the _Request_
includes a _Pending_ state which can be used to avoid declaring a separate pending state.

::alert{type="info"}
The request timeout is scheduled using the message scheduler, and the scheduled message is canceled when a response or fault is received. Not all message
schedulers support cancellation, so it may be necessary to _Ignore_ the `TimeoutExpired` event in subsequent states.
::

#### Missing Instance

If the saga instance has been finalized before the response, fault, or timeout have been received, it is possible to configure a missing instance handler,
similar to a regular event.

```csharp
Request(() => ProcessOrder, x => x.ProcessOrderRequestId, r =>
{
    r.Completed = m => m.OnMissingInstance(i => i.Discard());
    r.Faulted = m => m.OnMissingInstance(i => i.Discard());
    r.TimeoutExpired = m => m.OnMissingInstance(i => i.Discard());
});
```

### Custom

There are scenarios when an event behavior may have dependencies that need to be managed at a scope level, such as a database connection, or the complexity is
best encapsulated in a separate class rather than being part of the state machine itself. Developers can create their own activities for state machine use, and
optionally create their own extension methods to add them to a behavior.

To create an activity, create a class that implements `IStateMachineActivity<TInstance, TData>` as shown.

```csharp
public class PublishOrderSubmittedActivity :
    IStateMachineActivity<OrderState, SubmitOrder>
{
    readonly ISomeService _service;

    public PublishOrderSubmittedActivity(ISomeService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public void Probe(ProbeContext context)
    {
        context.CreateScope("publish-order-submitted");
    }

    public void Accept(StateMachineVisitor visitor)
    {
        visitor.Visit(this);
    }

    public async Task Execute(BehaviorContext<OrderState, SubmitOrder> context, IBehavior<OrderState, SubmitOrder> next)
    {
        await _service.OnOrderSubmitted(context.Saga.CorrelationId);
        
        // always call the next activity in the behavior
        await next.Execute(context).ConfigureAwait(false);
    }

    public Task Faulted<TException>(BehaviorExceptionContext<OrderState, SubmitOrder, TException> context, 
        IBehavior<OrderState, SubmitOrder> next)
        where TException : Exception
    {
        return next.Faulted(context);
    }
}
```

For _ISomeService_, implement the interface in a class that uses _IPublishEndpoint_ to publish the event as shown.

```csharp
public class SomeService :
    ISomeService
{
    IPublishEndpoint _publishEndpoint;
    
    public SomeService(IPublishEndpoint publishEndpoint)
    {
        _publishEndpoint = publishEndpoint;
    }
    
    public async Task OnOrderSubmitted(Guid orderId)
    {
        await _publishEndpoint.Publish<OrderSubmitted>(new { OrderId = orderId });
    }
}
```

Once created, configure the activity in a state machine as shown.

```csharp
public interface OrderSubmitted
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .Activity(x => x.OfType<PublishOrderSubmittedActivity>())
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }
}
```

When the `SubmitOrder` event is consumed, the state machine will resolve the activity from the container, and call the `Execute` method. The activity will be
scoped, so any dependencies will be resolved within the message `ConsumeContext`.

In the above example, the event type was known in advance. If an activity for any event type is needed, it can be created without specifying the event type.

```csharp
public class PublishOrderSubmittedActivity :
    IStateMachineActivity<OrderState>
{
    readonly ISomeService _service;

    public PublishOrderSubmittedActivity(ISomeService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public void Probe(ProbeContext context)
    {
        context.CreateScope("publish-order-submitted");
    }

    public void Accept(StateMachineVisitor visitor)
    {
        visitor.Visit(this);
    }

    public async Task Execute(BehaviorContext<OrderState> context, IBehavior<OrderState> next)
    {
        await _service.OnOrderSubmitted(context.Saga.CorrelationId);

        await next.Execute(context).ConfigureAwait(false);
    }

    public async Task Execute<T>(BehaviorContext<OrderState, T> context, IBehavior<OrderState, T> next)
    {
        await _service.OnOrderSubmitted(context.Saga.CorrelationId);

        await next.Execute(context).ConfigureAwait(false);
    }

    public Task Faulted<TException>(BehaviorExceptionContext<OrderState, TException> context, IBehavior<OrderState> next) 
        where TException : Exception
    {
        return next.Faulted(context);
    }

    public Task Faulted<T, TException>(BehaviorExceptionContext<OrderState, T, TException> context, IBehavior<OrderState, T> next)
        where TException : Exception
    {
        return next.Faulted(context);
    }
}
```

To register an instance activity, use the following syntax.

```csharp
public interface OrderSubmitted
{
    Guid OrderId { get; }    
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .Activity(x => x.OfInstanceType<PublishOrderSubmittedActivity>())
                .TransitionTo(Submitted));
    }
}
```
