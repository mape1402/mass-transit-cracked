# Videos

### YouTube

There are several seasons of videos [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8uyNNs1ri2MBx6BjPum5j9_MMdIfM9C), and new episodes are added fairly regularly. There are also many short-format [Commutes](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8uyNNs1ri2_ldsW1aPb7_8E2FI7ZtaI) that cover quick topics.

### Others

Beyond those videos, there are several other video presentations featuring MassTransit.

Others I'm sure, I just need to find them and link them here.
