# 7.0.4

Version 7.0.4 includes several new features which are detailed below. There were also numerous bug fixes, as well as tweaks to job consumers and batch consumers.

### General

MassTransit now references the .NET Core 2.1 version of Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions, which should now make v7 usable with that SDK version.

The endpoint name formatters now support adding a prefix to all endpoint names, including the namespace in addition to the type name, and creating instance-specific queues for consumers.

```cs
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<CommonConsumer>()
        .Endpoint(e => e.InstanceId = "SomeUniqueValue");
}); 
```

This would format the endpoint name as either `CommonSomeUniqueValue`, `common_some_unique_value`, or `common-some-unique-value`.

The prefix can be specified on the endpoint name formatter, as well as whether or not to include the namespace in the endpoint name.

```cs
services.AddSingleton<IEndpointNameFormatter>(provider => new KebabCaseEndpointNameFormatter("Dev", true));
```

This would format the endpoint name as `dev-my-service-contacts-common`, assuming that `CommonConsumer` was in the `MyService.Contracts` namespace.

### Transports

#### Amazon SNS

Topics are no longer created for published message types that include/implement other message types. Since SNS does not support polymorphic message routing, these topics were extraneous.

Queue attributes are now copied to error/skipped queues.

#### RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus

Message types can now be excluded from being created as exchanges or topics. Some other frameworks have stereotype interfaces such as `IAmAnEvent` or `IAmACommand`, or even base type interfaces like `IShouldBeTreatedAsAMessage`, and those interfaces would be used to create exchanges/topics for polymorphic message support. These interfaces can now be excluded using the publish topology configuration.

Using an attribute, a type can be excluded:

```cs
[ExcludeFromTopology]
public interface IEvent
{
    Guid TransactionId { get; }
}
```

The alternative is to configure the publish topology message type:

```cs
Bus.Factory.CreateUsingRabbitMq(cfg =>
{
    cfg.Publish<IEvent>(p => p.Exclude = true);
});
```

### Containers

#### In-Memory Test Harness

Registration for the test harness has been added, making it easier to test consumers using a container. To configure the in-memory test harness, see the example below.

```cs
 var provider = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddMassTransitInMemoryTestHarness(cfg =>
    {
        cfg.AddConsumer<PingRequestConsumer>();
    })
    .BuildServiceProvider(true);

var harness = provider.GetRequiredService<InMemoryTestHarness>();

await harness.Start();
try
{
    var bus = provider.GetRequiredService<IBus>();

    IRequestClient<PingMessage> client = bus.CreateRequestClient<PingMessage>();

    await client.GetResponse<PongMessage>(new PingMessage());

    Assert.That(await harness.Consumed.Any<PingMessage>());
}
finally
{
    await harness.Stop();

    await provider.DisposeAsync();
}
```

To include a consumer test harness for a consumer, additional configuration is required.

```cs
  var provider = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddMassTransitInMemoryTestHarness(cfg =>
    {
        cfg.AddConsumer<PingRequestConsumer>();

        cfg.AddConsumerTestHarness<PingRequestConsumer>();
    })
    .BuildServiceProvider(true);

var harness = provider.GetRequiredService<InMemoryTestHarness>();

await harness.Start();
try
{
    var bus = provider.GetRequiredService<IBus>();

    IRequestClient<PingMessage> client = bus.CreateRequestClient<PingMessage>();

    await client.GetResponse<PongMessage>(new PingMessage());

    Assert.That(await harness.Consumed.Any<PingMessage>());

    var consumerHarness = provider.GetRequiredService<IConsumerTestHarness<PingRequestConsumer>>();

    Assert.That(await consumerHarness.Consumed.Any<PingMessage>());
}
finally
{
    await harness.Stop();

    await provider.DisposeAsync();
}
```

Saga test harnesses can also be used, as shown below.

```cs
 var provider = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddMassTransitInMemoryTestHarness(cfg =>
    {
        cfg.AddSaga<TestSaga>()
            .InMemoryRepository();

        cfg.AddSagaTestHarness<TestSaga>();
    })
    .BuildServiceProvider(true);

var harness = provider.GetRequiredService<InMemoryTestHarness>();

await harness.Start();
try
{
    _sagaId = Guid.NewGuid();
    _testValueA = "TestValueA";

    await harness.Bus.Publish(new A
    {
        CorrelationId = _sagaId,
        Value = _testValueA
    });

    Assert.That(await harness.Published.Any<A>());

    Assert.That(await harness.Consumed.Any<A>());

    var sagaHarness = provider.GetRequiredService<ISagaTestHarness<TestSaga>>();

    Assert.That(await sagaHarness.Consumed.Any<A>());

    Assert.That(await sagaHarness.Created.Any(x => x.CorrelationId == _sagaId));

    var saga = sagaHarness.Created.Contains(_sagaId);
    Assert.That(saga, Is.Not.Null);
    Assert.That(saga.ValueA, Is.EqualTo(_testValueA));

    Assert.That(await harness.Published.Any<Aa>());

    Assert.That(await harness.Published.Any<B>(), Is.False);
}
finally
{
    await harness.Stop();

    await provider.DisposeAsync();
}
```

#### Scoped Filters

Container registration for [Scoped filters](/advanced/middleware/scoped) is now optional.

#### State Machine Activities

Container registration for state machine activities is now optional for Microsoft Extensions Dependency Injection and Autofac.
