## Kill Switch

A [Kill Switch](/advanced/middleware/killswitch) is used to prevent failing consumers from moving all the messages from the input queue to the error queue. By monitoring message consumption and tracking message successes and failures, a Kill Switch stops the receive endpoint when a trip threshold has been reached.
