# Requests

Request/response is a common pattern in application development, where a component sends a request to a service and continues once the response is received. In a distributed system, this can increase the latency of an application since the service may be hosted in another process, on another machine, or may even be a remote service in another network. While in many cases it is best to avoid request/response use in distributed applications, particularly when the request is a command, it is often necessary and preferred over more complex solutions.

Fortunately for .NET developers, C# with TPL makes it easier to program applications that call services asynchronously. By using *Tasks* and the *async* and *await* keywords, developers can write procedural code and avoid the complex use of callbacks and handlers. Additionally, multiple asynchronous requests can be executed at once, reducing the overall execution time to that of the longest request.

### Message Contracts

To get started, the message contracts need to be created. In this example, an order status check is being created.

```csharp
public interface CheckOrderStatus
{
    string OrderId { get; }
}

public interface OrderStatusResult
{
    string OrderId { get; }
    DateTime Timestamp { get; }
    short StatusCode { get; }
    string StatusText { get; }
}
```

### Request Consumer

In order for the request to return anything, it needs to be handled. Handling requests is done by using normal consumers. The only difference is that such consumer needs to send a response back.

For the aforementioned message contracts, the request handler can look like this:

```csharp
public class CheckOrderStatusConsumer : 
    IConsumer<CheckOrderStatus>
{
    readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;

    public CheckOrderStatusConsumer(IOrderRepository orderRepository)
    {
        _orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<CheckOrderStatus> context)
    {
        var order = await _orderRepository.Get(context.Message.OrderId);
        if (order == null)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Order not found");
        
        await context.RespondAsync<OrderStatusResult>(new 
        {
            OrderId = order.Id,
            order.Timestamp,
            order.StatusCode,
            order.StatusText
        });
    }
}
```

The response will be sent back to the requester. In case the exception is thrown, MassTransit will create a `Fault<CheckOrderStatus>` message and send it back to the requester. The requester address is available in the consume context of the request message as `context.ResponseAddress`.

### Request Client Configuration

Most interactions of the request/response nature consist of four elements: the request arguments, the response values, exception handling, and the time to wait for a response. The .NET framework gives us one additional element, a `CancellationToken`, which can cancel waiting for the response (the request is still sent, and may be processed, the CancellationToken only cancels waiting for the response).

MassTransit includes a request client which encapsulates the request/response messaging pattern.

::: tip V8
By default, MassTransit registers a generic request client in the container that publishes requests using the default request parameters. The only time a request client needs to be manually configured is when a specific _DestinationAddress_ or _Timeout_ is specified.
::: 

To configure the request client with a specific destination address, use the `AddRequestClient` method as shown below. The default request timeout may also be specified.

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMassTransit(x =>
    {
        x.AddConsumer<CheckOrderStatusConsumer>();

        x.UsingInMemory((context, cfg) =>
        {
            cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
        }));

        // ONLY required if the destination address must be specified
        x.AddRequestClient<CheckOrderStatus>(new Uri("exchange:order-status"));
    });
}
```

::: warning IMPORTANT
The bus _must_ be started, always. If requests are timing out, the bus is likely not started.
MassTransit registers a hosted service in the container, which is automatically started by the .NET Generic Host and ASP.NET Core.
:::

To use the request client, a controller (or a consumer) uses the client via a constructor dependency.

```csharp
public class RequestController :
    Controller
{
    IRequestClient<CheckOrderStatus> _client;

    public RequestController(IRequestClient<CheckOrderStatus> client)
    {
        _client = client;
    }

    public async Task<ActionResult> Get(string id)
    {
        var response = await _client.GetResponse<OrderStatusResult>(new {OrderId = id});

        return View(response.Message);
    }
}
```

The controller method will send the request and return the view once the response has been received.

### Request Headers

To create a request and add a header to the `SendContext`, use the callback overload as shown below.

```cs
await client.GetResponse<OrderStatusResult>(new { OrderId = id }, 
    x => x.UseExecute(context => context.Headers.Set("tenant-id", "some-value")));
```

Calling the `GetResponse` method triggers the request to be sent, after which the caller awaits the response. To add additional response types, see below for the tuple syntax, or just add multiple `GetResponse` methods, passing _false_ for the _readyToSend_ parameter.

### Multiple Requests

If there were multiple requests to be performed, it is easy to wait on all results at the same time, benefiting from the concurrent operation.

```csharp
public class RequestController : 
    Controller
{
    IRequestClient<RequestA> _clientA;
    IRequestClient<RequestB> _clientB;

    public RequestController(IRequestClient<RequestA> clientA, IRequestClient<RequestB> clientB)
    {
        _clientA = clientA;
        _clientB = clientB;
    }

    public async Task<ActionResult> Get()
    {
        var resultA = _clientA.GetResponse(new RequestA());
        var resultB = _clientB.GetResponse(new RequestB());

        await Task.WhenAll(resultA, resultB);

        var a = await resultA;
        var b = await resultB;

        var model = new Model(a.Message, b.Message);

        return View(model);
    }
}
```

The power of concurrency, for the win!

### Multiple Response Types

Another powerful feature with the request client is the ability support multiple (such as positive and negative) result types. For example, adding an `OrderNotFound` response type to the consumer as shown eliminates throwing an exception since a missing order isn't really a fault.

```csharp
public class CheckOrderStatusConsumer : 
    IConsumer<CheckOrderStatus>
{
    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<CheckOrderStatus> context)
    {
        var order = await _orderRepository.Get(context.Message.OrderId);
        if (order == null)
            await context.RespondAsync<OrderNotFound>(context.Message);
        else        
            await context.RespondAsync<OrderStatusResult>(new 
            {
                OrderId = order.Id,
                order.Timestamp,
                order.StatusCode,
                order.StatusText
            });
    }
}
```

The client can now wait for multiple response types (in this case, two) by using a little tuple magic.

```csharp
var response = await client.GetResponse<OrderStatusResult, OrderNotFound>(new { OrderId = id});

if (response.Is(out Response<OrderStatusResult> responseA))
{
    // do something with the order
}
else if (response.Is(out Response<OrderNotFound> responseB))
{
    // the order was not found
}
```

This cleans up the processing, an eliminates the need to catch a `RequestFaultException`.

It's also possible to use some of the switch expressions via deconstruction, but this requires the response variable to be explicitly specified as `Response`.

```cs
Response response = await client.GetResponse<OrderStatusResult, OrderNotFound>(new { OrderId = id});

// Using a regular switch statement
switch (response)
{
    case (_, OrderStatusResult a) responseA:
        // order found
        break;
    case (_, OrderNotFound b) responseB:
        // order not found
        break;
}

// Or using a switch expression
var accepted = response switch
{
    (_, OrderStatusResult a) => true,
    (_, OrderNotFound b) => false,
    _ => throw new InvalidOperationException()
};
```

### Request Client Accept Response Types

The request client sets a message header, `MT-Request-AcceptType`, that contains the response types supported by the request client. This allows the request consumer to determine if the client can handle a response type, which can be useful as services evolve and new response types may be added to handle new conditions. For instance, if a consumer adds a new response type, such as `OrderAlreadyShipped`, if the response type isn't supported an exception may be thrown instead. 

To see this in code, check out the client code:

```cs
var response = await client.GetResponse<OrderCanceled, OrderNotFound>(new CancelOrder());

if (response.Is(out Response<OrderCanceled> canceled))
{
    return Ok();
}
else if (response.Is(out Response<OrderNotFound> responseB))
{
    return NotFound();
}
```

The original consumer, prior to adding the new response type:

```cs
public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<CancelOrder> context)
{
    var order = _repository.Load(context.Message.OrderId);
    if(order == null)
    {
        await context.ResponseAsync<OrderNotFound>(new { context.Message.OrderId });
        return;
    }

    order.Cancel();

    await context.RespondAsync<OrderCanceled>(new { context.Message.OrderId });
}
```

Now, the new consumer that checks if the order has already shipped:

```cs
public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<CancelOrder> context)
{
    var order = _repository.Load(context.Message.OrderId);
    if(order == null)
    {
        await context.ResponseAsync<OrderNotFound>(new { context.Message.OrderId });
        return;
    }

    if(order.HasShipped)
    {
        if (context.IsResponseAccepted<OrderAlreadyShipped>())
        {
            await context.RespondAsync<OrderAlreadyShipped>(new { context.Message.OrderId, order.ShipDate });
            return;
        }
        else
            throw new InvalidOperationException("The order has already shipped"); // to throw a RequestFaultException in the client
    }

    order.Cancel();

    await context.RespondAsync<OrderCanceled>(new { context.Message.OrderId });
}
```

This way, the consumer can check the request client response types and act accordingly.

::: tip NOTE
For backwards compatibility, if the new `MT-Request-AcceptType` header is not found, `IsResponseAccepted` will return true for all message types.
:::

### Request Client Details

> The internals are documented for understanding, but what follows is optional reading. The above container-based configuration handles all the details to ensure the property context is used.

The request client is composed of two parts, a client factory, and a request client. The client factory is created from the bus, or a connected endpoint, and has the interface below (some overloads are omitted, but you get the idea).

```csharp
public interface IClientFactory 
{
    IRequestClient<T> CreateRequestClient<T>(ConsumeContext context, Uri destinationAddress, RequestTimeout timeout);

    IRequestClient<T> CreateRequestClient<T>(Uri destinationAddress, RequestTimeout timeout);

    RequestHandle<T> CreateRequest<T>(T request, Uri destinationAddress, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestTimeout timeout);

    RequestHandle<T> CreateRequest<T>(ConsumeContext context, T request, Uri destinationAddress, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestTimeout timeout);
}
```

As shown, the client factory can create a request client, or it can create a request directly. There are advantages to each approach, although it's typically best to create a request client and use it if possible. If a consumer is sending the request, a new client should be created for each message (and is handled automatically if you're using a dependency injection container and the container registration methods).

To create a client factory, call `bus.CreateClientFactory` or `host.CreateClientFactory` -- after the bus has been started.

The request client can be used to create requests (returning a `RequestHandle<T>`, which must be disposed after the request completes) or it can be used directly to send a request and get a response (asynchronously, of course).

> Using `Create` returns a request handle, which can be used to set headers and other attributes of the request before it is sent.

```csharp
public interface IRequestClient<TRequest>
    where TRequest : class
{
    RequestHandle<TRequest> Create(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestTimeout timeout);

    Task<Response<T>> GetResponse<T>(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestTimeout timeout);
}
```

> For `RequestTimeout` three options are available, `None`, `Default`, and a factory with `RequestTimeout.After`. `None` would never be recommended since it would essentially wait forever for a response. There is always a relevant timeout, or you're using the wrong pattern.

### Sending a Request

To create a request client, and use it to make a standalone request (not from a consumer, API controller, etc.):

```csharp
var serviceAddress = new Uri("rabbitmq://localhost/check-order-status");
var client = bus.CreateRequestClient<CheckOrderStatus>(serviceAddress);

var response = await client.GetResponse<OrderStatusResult>(new { OrderId = id});
```

The response type, `Response<OrderStatusResult>` includes the _MessageContext_ from when the response was received, providing access to the message properties (such as `response.ConversationId`) and headers (`response.Headers`).
