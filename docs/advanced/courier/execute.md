# Executing the routing slip

Once built, the routing slip is executed, which sends it to the first activityâ€™s execute URI. To make it easy and to ensure that source information is included, an extension method on *IBus* is available, the usage of which is shown below.

```csharp
await bus.Execute(routingSlip);
```

It should be pointed out that if the address for the first activity is invalid or cannot be reached, an exception will be thrown by the *Execute* method.
