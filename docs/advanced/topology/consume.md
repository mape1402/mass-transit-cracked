# Consume Topology

Each receive endpoint has a consume topology, which is configured as consumers are added. Depending upon the transport, additional methods may be available to support exchange bindings, topic subscriptions, etc.

The consume topology uses the publish topology to ensure consistent naming of exchanges/topics for message types.
